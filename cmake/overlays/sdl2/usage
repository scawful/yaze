SDL2 provides CMake targets:

  find_package(SDL2 CONFIG REQUIRED)
  target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE $<IF:$<TARGET_EXISTS:SDL2::SDL2>,SDL2::SDL2,SDL2::SDL2-static>)
  
  # SDL2::SDL2main may be optionally added manually to provide a main() function wrapper.
  # If you use this, don't use SDL_MAIN_HANDLED.
