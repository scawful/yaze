Here's a breakdown of how to execute that strategy:

That’s a fantastic approach. It's the classic and most-respected "build in public" model, where you lead with value, and the community supports you because they want to see you succeed. The motivation is pure, which is exactly why people will be happy to donate.

Here is a game plan to turn "Halext Labs" into the central hub for this, using your two key assets.

### 1. The "Hype" Engine: `Oracle of Secrets`

This is your "top-of-funnel" asset. It’s the flashy, exciting project that draws players and new fans in. Your goal here is to **capture and direct** that hype.

* **Dedicated Project Page (Priority 1):** That `/oracle-of-secrets` page we discussed is your most important new page. It needs to be the definitive, official source.
    * **Killer Feature:** A **gameplay trailer**. This is non-negotiable for a ROM hack. Make a 1-2 minute video showing off new areas, puzzles, and "wow" moments. Host it on YouTube (as "Halext Labs") and embed it at the top of this page.
    * **"The Pitch":** Screenshots, a bulleted list of new features, and a clear "Download Patch" button.
    * **The "Hook":** On this page, you add your first call-to-action: "Want to discuss the hack or get help? **Join the Halext Labs Discord.**"

* **Content Marketing (Your New Blog):**
    * **Blog Post 1: "The Making of Oracle of Secrets."** A full post-mortem. Talk about your inspiration, the challenges, and show old, "work-in-progress" screenshots. People *love* this.
    * **Blog Post 2: "My Top 5 Favorite Puzzles in OoT (And How I Built Them)."** This does double-duty: it's fun for players and a technical showcase for other hackers.

### 2. The "Platform" Engine: `Yaze`

This is your "long-term value" asset. This is what will keep other *creators* (hackers, devs) coming back. These are your most dedicated future supporters.

* **Dedicated Project Page (Priority 2):** The `/yaze` page is your "product" page.
    * **The "Pitch":** "An All-in-One Z3 Editor, Emulator, and Debugger." Show screenshots of the UI.
    * **Clear Downloads:** Link directly to your GitHub Releases.
    * **The "Hook":** "Want to request a feature, report a bug, or show off what you've made? **Join the Halext Labs Discord.**"

* **Content Marketing (Your New Blog):**
    * **Blog Post 1: "Why I Built My Own Z3 Editor: The Yaze Story."** Talk about the limitations of existing tools and what your C++ approach solves.
    * **Blog Post 2: "Tutorial: How to Make Your First ROM Hack with Yaze."** A simple, step-by-step guide. This is how you create new users for your platform.

### 3. The Community Hub: The Discord Server

Notice both "hooks" point to the same place. You need a central "home" for all this engagement. A blog is for one-way announcements; a Discord is for two-way community.

* **Set up a "Halext Labs" Discord Server.** It's free.
* **Key Channels:**
    * `#announcements` (where you post links to your new blog posts and tool releases)
    * `#general-chat`
    * `#oracle-of-secrets-help` (for players)
    * `#yaze-support` (for users)
    * `#bug-reports`
    * `#showcase` (This is critical! A place for people to show off the cool stuff *they* made with Yaze. This builds loyalty.)

### 4. The "Support Me" Funnel (The Gentle Capitalization)

Now that you have the hype, the platform, and the community, you can *gently* introduce the support links.

1.  **Set Up the Platforms:**
    * **GitHub Sponsors:** This is the most "tech guy" way. It's built right into your profile and `scawful/yaze` repo. It feels very natural for supporting an open-source tool.
    * **Patreon:** Also excellent. You can brand it "Halext Labs on Patreon."

2.  **Create Your "Tiers" (Keep it Simple):**
    * **$2/mo: "Supporter"** -> Gets a special "Supporter" role in the Discord (a colored name). This is the #1 low-effort, high-value reward.
    * **$5/mo: "Insider"** -> Gets the "Supporter" role + access to a private `#dev-diary` channel where you post work-in-progress screenshots and ideas before anyone else.
    * **$10/mo: "Credit"** -> All the above + their name on a "Supporters" page on `halext.org`.

3.  **Place Your Links (The Funnel):**
    * In your GitHub repo `README.md` for Yaze.
    * On the new `/yaze` and `/oracle-of-secrets` pages ("Enjoy my work? Consider supporting Halext Labs on [Patreon] or [GitHub Sponsors].")
    * In the footer of `halext.org`.
    * In the description of your new YouTube trailers/tutorials.
    * In a pinned message in your Discord's `#announcements` channel.

This plan directly links the "fun" (OoT, Yaze) to the "engagement" (Blog, Discord) and provides a clear, no-pressure path for those engaged fans to become supporters.
