# Editor Performance Monitoring Setup

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive performance monitoring across all YAZE editors to identify loading bottlenecks and optimize the entire application startup process.

## ‚úÖ **Completed Tasks**

### 1. **Performance Timer Standardization**
- Cleaned up and standardized all performance monitoring timers
- Added consistent `core::ScopedTimer` usage across all editors
- Integrated with the existing `core::PerformanceMonitor` system

### 2. **Editor Timing Implementation**
Added performance timing to all 8 editor `Load()` methods:

| Editor | File | Status |
|--------|------|--------|
| **OverworldEditor** | `overworld/overworld_editor.cc` | ‚úÖ Already had timing |
| **DungeonEditor** | `dungeon/dungeon_editor.cc` | ‚úÖ Added timing |
| **ScreenEditor** | `graphics/screen_editor.cc` | ‚úÖ Added timing |
| **SpriteEditor** | `sprite/sprite_editor.cc` | ‚úÖ Added timing |
| **MessageEditor** | `message/message_editor.cc` | ‚úÖ Added timing |
| **MusicEditor** | `music/music_editor.cc` | ‚úÖ Added timing |
| **PaletteEditor** | `graphics/palette_editor.cc` | ‚úÖ Added timing |
| **SettingsEditor** | `system/settings_editor.cc` | ‚úÖ Added timing |

### 3. **Implementation Details**

Each editor now includes:
```cpp
#include "app/core/performance_monitor.h"

absl::Status [EditorName]::Load() {
  core::ScopedTimer timer("[EditorName]::Load");
  
  // ... existing loading logic ...
  
  return absl::OkStatus();
}
```

## üéØ **Expected Results**

When you run the application and load a ROM, you'll now see detailed timing for each editor:

```
=== Performance Summary ===
Operation                     Count       Total (ms)     Average (ms)   
------------------------------------------------------------------------
OverworldEditor::Load         1           XXX            XXX           
DungeonEditor::Load           1           XXX            XXX           
ScreenEditor::Load            1           XXX            XXX

MusicEditor::Load             1           XXX            XXX           
PaletteEditor::Load           1           XXX            XXX           
SettingsEditor::Load          1           XXX            XXX           
LoadAllGraphicsData           1           XXX            XXX           
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

## üîç **Bottleneck Identification Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Baseline Measurement**
Run the application and collect performance data to identify:
- Which editors are slowest to load
- Total loading time breakdown
- Memory usage patterns during loading

### **Phase 2: Targeted Optimization**
Based on the results, focus optimization efforts on:
- **Slowest Editors**: Apply lazy loading or deferred initialization
- **Memory-Intensive Operations**: Implement progressive loading
- **I/O Bound Operations**: Add caching or parallel processing

### **Phase 3: Advanced Optimizations**
- **Parallel Editor Loading**: Load independent editors concurrently
- **Predictive Loading**: Pre-load editors likely to be used
- **Resource Pooling**: Share resources between editors

## üöÄ **Next Steps**

1. **Run Performance Test**: Load a ROM and collect the performance summary
2. **Identify Bottlenecks**: Find the slowest editors (likely candidates: DungeonEditor, ScreenEditor)
3. **Apply Optimizations**: Implement lazy loading for slow editors
4. **Measure Improvements**: Compare before/after performance

## üìä **Expected Findings**

Based on typical patterns, we expect to find:

- **OverworldEditor**: Already optimized (should be fast)
- **DungeonEditor**: Likely slow (complex dungeon data loading)
- **ScreenEditor**: Potentially slow (graphics processing)
- **SpriteEditor**: Likely fast (minimal loading)
- **MessageEditor**: Likely fast (text data only)
- **MusicEditor**: Likely fast (minimal loading)
- **PaletteEditor**: Likely fast (small palette data)
- **SettingsEditor**: Likely fast (configuration only)

## üéâ **Benefits**

- **Complete Visibility**: See exactly where time is spent during ROM loading
- **Targeted Optimization**: Focus efforts on the real bottlenecks
- **Measurable Progress**: Track improvements with concrete metrics
- **User Experience**: Faster application startup and responsiveness

The performance monitoring system is now ready to identify and help optimize the remaining bottlenecks in YAZE's loading process!
