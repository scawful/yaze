## Active Documentation

For current documentation, see the parent directory:
- `../README.md` - Main entry point
- `../E6-z3ed-implementation-plan.md` - Master task tracker
- `../NEXT_PRIORITIES_OCT2.md` - Current work breakdown
- `../IT-01-QUICKSTART.md` - Test harness quick reference

## Why Archive?

These documents served their purpose during active development but:
- Contained redundant information now consolidated in main docs
- Were point-in-time snapshots superseded by later updates  
- Detailed low-level implementation notes for completed phases
- Decision documents for choices that are now finalized

They remain available for:
- Understanding historical context
- Reviewing implementation decisions
- Learning from the development process
- Troubleshooting if issues arise with older code
