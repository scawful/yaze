# z3ed Documentation Archive

**Last Updated**: October 2, 2025

## Purpose

This archive contains historical documentation from the z3ed development process. These documents capture implementation decisions, progress logs, and technical investigations that led to the current design.

**⚠️ Note**: These documents are **historical references only**. For current information, see the main documentation in the parent directory.

## Archive Contents

- **DEPENDENCY_MANAGEMENT.md** - Build system and dependency strategy

### Implementation Progress Logs

- **GRPC_TEST_SUCCESS.md** - IT-01 Phase 1 completion (gRPC infrastructure working)
- **IT-01-PHASE2-IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md** - TestManager integration guide

## Superseded By

All information in these archived documents has been consolidated into:

1. **[E6-z3ed-cli-design.md](../E6-z3ed-cli-design.md)** - Architecture and design decisions
2. **[E6-z3ed-reference.md](../E6-z3ed-reference.md)** - Technical reference and APIs
3. **[E6-z3ed-implementation-plan.md](../E6-z3ed-implementation-plan.md)** - Current status and roadmap
4. **[IT-01-QUICKSTART.md](../IT-01-QUICKSTART.md)** - Test harness usage guide
5. **[AGENT_TEST_QUICKREF.md](../AGENT_TEST_QUICKREF.md)** - CLI agent test reference
6. **[PROJECT_STATUS_OCT2.md](../PROJECT_STATUS_OCT2.md)** - Current project status

## When to Reference Archive

Use archived documents when:
- Investigating why a particular technical decision was made
- Understanding the evolution of the codebase
- Debugging platform-specific issues covered in technical notes
- Reviewing historical performance metrics or test results

## Retention Policy

These documents are retained for:
- **Historical reference**: Understanding design evolution
- **Troubleshooting**: Platform-specific quirks and workarounds
- **Knowledge transfer**: New contributors understanding project history

Documents may be removed after 6 months if their content is fully superseded and no longer referenced.

**Archive Created**: October 2, 2025  
**Purpose**: Preserve development history and technical investigations

## Archived Documentation

### State Summaries (Historical Snapshots)
- `STATE_SUMMARY_2025-10-01.md` - State before IT-01 Phase 3 completion
- `STATE_SUMMARY_2025-10-02.md` - State after IT-01 Phase 3 completion
- `PROGRESS_SUMMARY_2025-10-02.md` - Daily progress log for Oct 2, 2025

### IT-01 (ImGuiTestHarness) Implementation Guides
- `IT-01-grpc-evaluation.md` - Decision rationale for choosing gRPC over alternatives
- `IT-01-getting-started-grpc.md` - Initial gRPC integration guide
- `IT-01-PHASE2-IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md` - Phase 2 detailed implementation
- `IT-01-PHASE3-COMPLETE.md` - Phase 3 completion report with API learnings
- `GRPC_TEST_SUCCESS.md` - Phase 1 test results and validation
- `GRPC_TECHNICAL_NOTES.md` - Build issues and solutions

### Project Management
- `DOCUMENTATION_CONSOLIDATION_OCT2.md` - Notes on documentation cleanup process
- `FILE_MODIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md` - Build system changes checklist
- `DEPENDENCY_MANAGEMENT.md` - Cross-platform dependency strategy

## Active Documentation

For current documentation, see the parent directory:
- `../README.md` - Main entry point
- `../E6-z3ed-implementation-plan.md` - Master task tracker
- `../NEXT_PRIORITIES_OCT2.md` - Current work breakdown
- `../IT-01-QUICKSTART.md` - Test harness quick reference

## Why Archive?

These documents served their purpose during active development but:
- Contained redundant information now consolidated in main docs
- Were point-in-time snapshots superseded by later updates  
- Detailed low-level implementation notes for completed phases
- Decision documents for choices that are now finalized

They remain available for:
- Understanding historical context
- Reviewing implementation decisions
- Learning from the development process
- Troubleshooting if issues arise with older code
