# Getting Started

This software allows you to modify "The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past".

This editor is built to be compatible with ZScream projects.

Please note that this project is currently a work in progress, and some features may not be fully implemented or may be subject to change.

## Prerequisites
Before you start using YAZE, make sure you have the following:

- A copy of "The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past" ROM file (US or JP)
- Basic knowledge of hexadecimal and binary data

## General Tips

- Experiment flags determine whether certain features are enabled or not. To change your flags, go to File -> Options -> Experiment Flags or open the SettingsEditor tab.
- Backup files are enabled by default. Each save will produce a timestamped copy of your ROM before you last saved.
