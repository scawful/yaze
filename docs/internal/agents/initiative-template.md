# AI Initiative Template

Use this template when kicking off a sizable AI-driven effort (infrastructure, editor refactor,
automation tooling, etc.). Keep the filled-out document alongside other planning notes and reference
it from the coordination board.

```

After filling in the template:

2. Link the initiative file from your board entries so other agents can find details without copying
   sections into multiple docs.
3. Archive or mark the initiative as complete when the success metrics are met.
