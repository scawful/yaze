# YAZE Handbook

Internal documentation for planning, AI agents, research, and historical build notes. These
files are intentionally excluded from the public Doxygen site so they can remain verbose and
speculative without impacting the published docs.

## Sections
- `agents/` – z3ed and AI agent playbooks, command abstractions, and debugging guides.
- `blueprints/` – architectural proposals, refactors, and technical deep dives.
- `roadmaps/` – sequencing, feature parity analysis, and postmortems.
- `research/` – emulator investigations, timing analyses, web ideas, and development trackers.
- `legacy/` – superseded build guides and other historical docs kept for reference.

When adding new internal docs, place them under the appropriate subdirectory here instead of
`docs/`.
