# Documentation Relocated

The published documentation now lives under [`docs/public`](public/index.md) so that Doxygen can
focus on the curated guides and references. All planning notes, AI/agent workflows, and research
documents have been moved to the repository-level [`docs/internal/`](../docs/internal/README.md).

Update your bookmarks:
- Public site entry point: [`docs/public/index.md`](public/index.md)
- Internal docs: [`docs/internal/README.md`](../docs/internal/README.md)
