Been making lots of adjustments and cleaning up old code. Primarily improving the dungeon map editor and supporting bin graphics for my Oracle of Secrets dungeon maps. Additionally, working to support saving for resources like graphics sheets and expanded the project file system.

Various header cleanup using the LSP in emacs to detect unused includes.
Making adjustments to font loading so the editor can be opened from terminal/emacs.
Currently the font files and the zeml files require the binary to be relative to `assets/layouts` and `assets/fonts`
I've set it up so that the macOS app bundles the resources into the `yaze.app` so that the binary can be run from anywhere. This will need to be adjusted for other platforms.

Extracted the DisplayPalette function out of the PaletteEditor and into its own standalone function.

Started learning spacemacs and org-mode.
