3. **Resource Pooling**: Reuse SDL textures and surfaces (30% memory reduction)

### Medium Impact, Medium Risk (Phase 2)
1. **Tile Caching System**: LRU cache for frequently used tiles
2. **Batch Operations**: Group texture updates for efficiency
3. **Memory Pool Allocator**: Custom allocator for graphics data

### High Impact, High Risk (Phase 3)
1. **Atlas-based Rendering**: Single draw calls for multiple tiles
2. **Multi-threaded Updates**: Background texture processing
3. **GPU-based Operations**: Move operations to GPU
