## AI & Automation

### Autonomous Debugging Enhancements

Advanced features for AI-driven emulator debugging (see E9-ai-agent-debugging-guide.md for current capabilities).

#### Pattern 1: Automated Bug Reproduction
```python
def reproduce_bug_scenario():
    """Reproduce a specific bug automatically"""
    # 1. Load game state
    stub.LoadState(StateRequest(slot=1))

    # 2. Set breakpoint at suspected bug location
    stub.AddBreakpoint(BreakpointRequest(
        address=0x01A5C0,  # Enemy spawn routine
        type=BreakpointType.EXECUTE,
        description="Bug: enemy spawns in wall"
    ))

    # 3. Automate input to trigger bug
    stub.PressButtons(ButtonRequest(buttons=[Button.UP]))
    stub.HoldButtons(ButtonHoldRequest(buttons=[Button.A], duration_ms=500))

    # 4. Wait for breakpoint
    hit = stub.RunToBreakpoint(Empty())
    if hit.hit:
        # 5. Capture state for analysis
        memory = stub.ReadMemory(MemoryRequest(
            address=0x7E0000,  # WRAM
            size=0x10000
        ))

        # 6. Analyze and log
        analyze_enemy_spawn_state(hit.cpu_state, memory.data)

        return True
    return False
```

#### Pattern 2: Automated Code Coverage Analysis
```python
def analyze_code_coverage():
    """Find untested code paths"""
    # 1. Enable disassembly recording
    stub.CreateDebugSession(DebugSessionRequest(
        session_name="coverage_test",
        enable_all_features=True
    ))

    # 2. Run gameplay for 10 minutes
    stub.Start(Empty())
    time.sleep(600)
    stub.Pause(Empty())

    # 3. Get execution trace
    disasm = stub.GetDisassembly(DisassemblyRequest(
        start_address=0x008000,
        count=10000,
        include_execution_count=True
    ))

    # 4. Find unexecuted code
    unexecuted = [line for line in disasm.lines if line.execution_count == 0]

    print(f"Code coverage: {len(disasm.lines) - len(unexecuted)}/{len(disasm.lines)}")
    print(f"Untested code at:")
    for line in unexecuted[:20]:  # Show first 20
        print(f"  ${line.address:06X}: {line.mnemonic} {line.operand_str}")
```

#### Pattern 3: Autonomous Bug Hunting
```python
def hunt_for_bugs():
    """AI-driven bug detection"""
    # Set watchpoints on critical variables
    watchpoints = [
        ("LinkHealth", 0x7EF36D, 0x7EF36D, True, True),
        ("LinkPos", 0x7E0020, 0x7E0023, False, True),
        ("RoomID", 0x7E00A0, 0x7E00A1, False, True),
    ]

    for name, start, end, track_reads, track_writes in watchpoints:
        stub.AddWatchpoint(WatchpointRequest(
            start_address=start,
            end_address=end,
            track_reads=track_reads,
            track_writes=track_writes,
            break_on_access=False,
            description=name
        ))

    # Run game with random inputs
    stub.Start(Empty())

    for _ in range(1000):  # 1000 random actions
        button = random.choice([Button.UP, Button.DOWN, Button.LEFT,
                               Button.RIGHT, Button.A, Button.B])
        stub.PressButtons(ButtonRequest(buttons=[button]))
        time.sleep(0.1)

        # Check for anomalies every 10 actions
        if _ % 10 == 0:
            status = stub.GetDebugStatus(Empty())

            # Check for crashes or freezes
            if status.fps < 30:
                print(f"ANOMALY: Low FPS detected ({status.fps:.2f})")
                save_crash_dump(status)

            # Check for memory corruption
            health = stub.ReadMemory(MemoryRequest(
                address=0x7EF36D, size=1
            ))
            if health.data[0] > 0xA8:  # Max health
                print(f"BUG: Health overflow! Value: {health.data[0]:02X}")
                stub.Pause(Empty())
                break
```
